# Inventory-Management-App
This is an inventory management system for the manufacturing industry.  The application allows the user to add parts to the system, categorized as either in-house or outsourced.  Once parts are added, the user can then add a product with various chosen parts associated with it's production.  Individual parts are assigned a machine ID number to indicate which equipment the part is manufactured on.  A part record can also be modified, viewed, and deleted as necessary.  The same goes for a product, however, it cannot be deleted until all parts are disassociated with it.  The user can search both part and product records as needed to expedite their experience.
